# Reddit-ChatGPT-bot
A python script for reading post title and content, sending to ChatGPT for a response and then commenting the ChatGPT response. 
Download the Python file and change the API and login details and then run the file. 
To use GPT4, change the model in the file. I do not have access to GPT4 API yet to test but it should work just fine.
